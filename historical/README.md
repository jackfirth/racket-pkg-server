# Historical approaches to packaging

This directory contains experiments in packaging the Racket package
catalog server together with the `racket-pkg-website` frontend.

 - `docker` contains a dockerized server. We ended up not going down
   the docker path.

 - `standalone` contains the original scripts used to set up the live
   server.
